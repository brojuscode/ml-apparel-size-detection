Conducted an in-depth research on recommending the correct apparel size using different machine learning algorithms. 
The project aimed to suggest the accurate apparel size by identifying the person (through a custom dataset) and the key points to calculate the measurement ratio. 
After extensive testing and refinement, the solution achieved approximately 95% accuracy. 
Tools used: Python, TensorFlow, Openpose, Detectron, YOLOv8
